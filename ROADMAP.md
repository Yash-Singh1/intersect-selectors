# Roadmap

Some features that are not supported and may be supported in the future:

- Adjacent Sibling and Sibling Combinator Distinction

Currently, adjacent siblings and sibling combinators are considered as the same thing because considering them as distinct would require a lot of complex logic.

- Parsing and interpreting pseudo-classes such as `nth-child` and `not`
